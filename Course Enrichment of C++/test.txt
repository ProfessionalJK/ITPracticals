+ can be used for objects addition too.
Operator overloading:
different operators that we use can perform the specific operations on primitive type of operators. e.g. + performs addidtion of int and float values by default.
To extend the funcationality of these operators we can achieve operator overloading that will make those operators to perform similar operations on objects also.
e.g. 	a	+	b

	object	|	object
	overloaded operator
Exceptional case
operator overloading is a compile time polymorphism.

pure virtual function makes the super class abstract.
